# The Sensori-Neuro-Actuative Class

I am interested in neuromusculur-biomechanical systems.
I am even more interested in **sensori-neuro-actuative** systems as a parent class
that includes the biological neuromuscular-biomechanical system and the integration
of non-biological materials as prosthetics or tissue implants.

## A muscle is an actuative biological tissue.

What makes it actuative is the same thing that make robotic actuators actuative.

To actuate is to influence, to change the physical state of. 

communication is transmitter actuation on a receiver

hybridizing computational and actuative systems is what robotics is all about.

Understanding this hybridization in neuromuscular systems and
how synthetic materials, both computational, actuative, sensorial,
and bulk type 

senori-neuro-actuative system

if we define neuro as modularized compartments with well-define boundaries

and neuro connections as I/O channels 

inputs and outputs that affect the physical state of the receiver

communicating across those boundaries
