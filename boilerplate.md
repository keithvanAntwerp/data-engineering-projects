## NMSCE: Neuro, Musculo, Skeleto-Connectio, Enviro 

The primary function of the nervous system is to move the body by
coordinating the activation of muscle tissue based on the 
real-time processing of sensory data
to achieve "goals" ranging from homeostatic regulation to predicting
the trajectory of material systems or economic markets.

## Science and Machine Learning
One might say that science likes to pin down a rule that is essentially a function
that maps a system state to a future system state.

This process requires: 

1. defining the state

2. establishing **observables** that allow estimation of that state

3. building a model

4. making a testable prediction with that model

5. testing the prediction through experiment

6. considering the complexity of the model (Occam's Razor)

In biomedicine these observables are **imaging**, **scans** and **tissue-system-O-GRAMS** like ECG, EMG and EEG along with the 
machine that goes `print("PING!")`

## Neural Sensorimotor Integration (NSI) Decoding

NSI decodings are algorithms that estimate
the internal network structure of biological NMSC
based on motion capture and electromyographic (EMG) data.

The Central Nervous System (CNS) is viewed as a multi-task-driven, 
real-time sensory processor that must execute motor (output) sequences
to achieve multiple goals.

Sometimes a CNS is tasked with finding any solution
i.e. exploring the solution space.

Other times a CNS is tasked with choosing one of many apparently equivalent solutions.

Exploring and exploiting solutions sums up very well the task of the CNS.

## The SensoriMotor Loop

```python

class SensoriMotor_loop():
    '''Construct a sensorimotor loop
     
    '''
    def __init__(self, tau):
        self.tau_description = '''a single number quantifying loop time
                                  for a point in loop it is the time-delay
                                  IMPORTANT: carefully consider reference before defining time-delay
                                  
                                  Loops are directed as DAGS, Where nodes are at
                                  Steady State with stochastic functionality
                                  
                                  '''
        
```

I am interested in **sensori-neuro-actuator** (SNA) systems that include:

+ purely biological SNA systems
  + e.g. neurosensory and neuromuscular biomechanical systems
+ purely non-biological SNA Systems 
  + e.g. silicon computing systems, robotic systems
+ hybridization of biological-non-biological SNA systems (BNB hybrdization)

From Delp to Susskind:

modular SNA nodes have time-index flux through defined **2D boundary**

### sensori:

listens for informative inputs encoded in a finite alphabet

### neuro-, nodal-; neurons and nodes; both types of vertex

a computing system that internally comprises well-defined computing **modules**.

#### modules: a vertex within a vertex

defined as a set of physical states
contained by a **spatiotemporal boundary B**

**inputs and outputs (I/O)**: discrete signal time-indexed threads
fluxing through **B**

graph edge: relation type: {connection, communication} (between modules)

### actuator:

To actuate is to influence, to change the physical state of. 

communication is a transmitter-actuation on a receiver

hybridizing computational and actuative systems is what robotics is all about.

Understanding this hybridization in neuromuscular systems and
how synthetic materials, both computational, actuative, sensorial,
and bulk-mechanical type
