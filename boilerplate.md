## NMS

The primary function of the nervous system is the
coordination of muscle tissue based on the real-time processing of sensory data
to achieve a range of "goals" from homeostatic regulation to predicting
the trajectory of material bodies.

+ Musculo

+ Skeletal

It seems like science likes to pin down a rule that is essentially a function
that maps a system state to a future system state.
This requires an 

1. **observables** that allows estimation of that state (location in state space).

In biomedicine these observables are **IMAGES** and **tissue-system-O-GRAMS** (e.g.
electrocardiogram, electromyogram, electroencephalogram)

## Neural Sensorimotor Integration (NSI) Decoder

NSI decoder is artifical intelligence that estimates
the internal network structure of biological-like neuromechanical networks
based on motion capture and electromyographic (EMG) data.

The Central Nervous System (CNS) is viewed as a multi-task-driven, 
real-time sensory processor that must execute motor (output) sequences
to achieve multiple goals.

Sometimes a CNS is tasked with finding any solution
i.e. exploring the solution space.

Other times a CNS is tasked with choosing one of many apparently equivalent solutions.

Exploring and exploiting solutions sums up very well the task of the CNS.

The hybridzation of neural systems and synthetic micro-systems


## (sensori-neuro-actuator)-(mechano-enviro) systems (SNA-ME)

SNA forms a sensorimotor loop

```python

class SNA_loop():
    '''Construct a sensorimotor loop
    Abstract Nodal Network Loop Object 
    '''
    def __init__(self, tau):
        self.tau_description = '''a single number quantifying loop time
                                  for a point in loop it is the time-delay
                                  IMPORTANT: carefully consider reference before defining time-delay
                                  
                                  Loops are directed as DAGS, Where nodes are at
                                  Steady State with stochastic functionality
                                  
                                  '''
        



```

I am interested in **sensori-neuro-actuator** (SNA) systems that include:

+ purely biological SNA systems
  + e.g. neurosensory and neuromuscular biomechanical systems
+ purely non-biological SNA Systems 
  + e.g. silicon computing systems, robotic systems
+ hybridization of biological-non-biological SNA systems (BNB hybrdization)

From Delp to Susskind:

modular SNA nodes have time-index flux through defined **2D boundary**

### sensori:

listens for informative inputs encoded in a finite alphabet

### neuro-, nodal-; neurons and nodes; both types of vertex

a computing system that internally comprises well-defined computing **modules**.

#### modules: a vertex within a vertex

defined as a set of physical states
contained by a **spatiotemporal boundary B**

**inputs and outputs (I/O)**: discrete signal time-indexed threads
fluxing through **B**

graph edge: relation type: {connection, communication} (between modules)

### actuator:

To actuate is to influence, to change the physical state of. 

communication is a transmitter-actuation on a receiver

hybridizing computational and actuative systems is what robotics is all about.

Understanding this hybridization in neuromuscular systems and
how synthetic materials, both computational, actuative, sensorial,
and bulk-mechanical type
