# Apache Cassandra
  
> Apache Cassandra is an open source, distributed, decentralized, elastically
scalable, highly available, fault-tolerant, tuneably consistent, row-oriented
database, that bases its distribution design on Amazon's Dynamo and its data model
on Google's Bigtable. Created at Facebook, it is now used at some of the most popular
sites on the web.
