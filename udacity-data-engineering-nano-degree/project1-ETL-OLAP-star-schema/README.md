# project1-etl-olap-star-schema

A music streaming company Sparkify has deployed a music streaming app.
The Sparkify analytics team wants a **PostgreSQL**
database and ETL pipeline with a schema and flow optimized for song play analysis.

1. **Extract** data from 2 collections of *JSON* files (almost).
Local directory structure and paths are provided.

2. **Transform** data into a star schema optimized for songplay analysis

3. **Load** in to customized _PostgreSQL Version ?_ database.

## Specified Project Constraints and Schema

## Data Type Considerations

* explicit type validations
  * input source file format and encoding: `JSON`
    * _Python 3_ `str()`
    * _PostgreSQL_ `varchar`
  * number type considerations
    * integer
    * floating-point
    * precise numeric
  * datatime type considerations
    * 
  * other data type considerations
*minimize resource cost: `min{[time, FLOPS, ]}`

## Efficiency and Complexity 

* time
* computing
* process operations
* memory considerations
* other goals:
* security
* reliability
* adaptability

### Dates

JavaScript Date objects are represented by the number of milliseconds since midnight
January 1, 1970. When the Date object is instantiated, the timestamp is in local device time.
