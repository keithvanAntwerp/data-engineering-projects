# Apache Cassandra
Apache Cassandra is a distributed {'NoSQL':"Not only sequal"} database management system (DBMS).
It is designed to handle large amounts of data **distrubuted** across many nodes. 
A node in this case is a machine or virtual machine containing {processors, hierarchtical memory, network I/O handling}
shelled by a user operating system (UNIX, windows NT, other)
In the case of Apache Cassandra these nodes are clusters of servers.
The clusters of servers can be distributed in multiple datacenters on Earth.
Perhaps collections of computing servers will be distributed across other material bodies
and in interplanetary space will be common in the future.


Distributed systems offer robost availability with no single point of failure.
